#lecture3_git

Hello, my name is George
This is my first GitHub repo (that's not true)

I created this repository directly from my local machine using git commands
I didn't forget to include supportive materials such as .gitignore and requirements.txt and this README file as well
Then I created a few branches carrying a few files carrying some code
Finally I merged new commits to 'main' branch using git commands and GitHub pull request feature
